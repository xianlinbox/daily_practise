# Region

a geographical area that contains one or more Azure datacenters that are connected via a low-latency network.

- Azure has over 60 regions worldwide (more than any other cloud provider).
- Each region is paired with another (called a regional pair) to support disaster recovery and data redundancy.
- Not all services are available in every region (check the Products by Region page).

## AZ

An Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically separate datacenter within a region, each with its own power, cooling, and
networking. Each region with zone support has at least 3 AZs.
