In last episode, we have created accounts to hold the aws resources. In this episode we gonna talk about the network connectivity. network connectivity is essential for designing secure, efficient, and cost-effective cloud environments.

# AWS global infrastructure

Before dive into network connectivity, we should have a big picture about AWS cloud infra. The Global infra is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones:

- **Region**: a physical location in the world where have multiple Availability Zones
- **Availabity Zone**: Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers

Based on the gobal infra, AWS provided a bunch of services to reduce network latency:

- Local Zone: Run applications on AWS infrastructure closer to your end users and workloads
- Wavelength: Embed AWS compute and storage services within communications service providersâ€™ (CSP) 5G networks
- Edge Network services: Global Accelerator, CloudFront, Route 53, lambda@Edge etc
- DX locations: Create a dedicated network connection to AWS
