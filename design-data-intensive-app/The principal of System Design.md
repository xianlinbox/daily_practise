As a architect, when we doing a system design, the main taget is creating scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems

# Reliability

The system should work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level) even face the
adversitty(hardware or software faults, and even human error).

# Scalability

As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing with
that growth

# Maintainability

Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and oper‚Äê ations, both maintaining current
behavior and adapting the system to new use cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively
